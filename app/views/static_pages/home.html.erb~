	<h2>Step 1: Set Yourself up for Success </h2>
<ul>
  <h5> Simplify.</h5> Instead of being overly concerned with counting calories or measuring portion sizes, think of your diet in terms of color, variety, and freshness. 
  <h5> Start slow and make changes to your eating habits over time.</h5> Make small steps, like adding a salad (full of different color vegetables) to your diet once a day or switching from butter to olive oil when cooking.  As your small changes become habit, you can continue to add more healthy choices to your diet.
  <h5>  Every change you make to improve your diet matters.</h5> You don’t have to be perfect and you don’t have to completely eliminate foods you enjoy to have a healthy diet. The long term goal is to feel good, have more energy, and reduce the risk of cancer and disease.

<h2>Step 2: Moderation is key</h2>
<ul>
<h5>Try not to think of certain foods as “off-limits.”</h5> When you ban certain foods or food groups, it is natural to want those foods more. If you are drawn towards sweet, salty, or unhealthy foods, start by reducing portion sizes and not eating them as often.
<h5>Think smaller portions.</h5> Serving sizes have ballooned recently, particularly in restaurants. When dining out, choose a starter instead of an entree, split a dish with a friend, and don't order supersized anything. At home, use smaller plates, think about serving sizes in realistic terms, and start small. If you don't feel satisfied at the end of a meal, try adding more leafy green vegetables or rounding off the meal with fresh fruit.
</ul>

<h2>Step 3:It's not just what you eat, it's how you eat</h2>
<ul>
  <h5>Eat with others whenever possible.</h5> Eating with other people has numerous social and emotional benefits.Eating in front of the TV or computer often leads to mindless overeating.
  <h5>Take time to chew your food and enjoy mealtimes.</h5> Chew your food slowly, savoring every bite. Reconnect with the joy of eating.
 <h5>Listen to your body.</h5> Ask yourself if you are really hungry, or have a glass of water to see if you are thirsty instead of hungry. 
 <h5>Eat breakfast, and eat smaller meals throughout the day</h5>. 
 <h5>Avoid eating at night.</h5> 
</ul>
